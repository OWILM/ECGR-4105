# Develop a SVR regression model that predicts housing price based on the following input variables:
# Area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, parking, prefarea
# Plot your regression model for SVR similar to the sample code provided on the course GitHub. 
# Compare your results against linear regression with regularization loss that you already did in HW 1. 
# Explore different kernel tricks to capture non-linearities within your data. 
# Plot the results and compare the accuracies for different kernels.
