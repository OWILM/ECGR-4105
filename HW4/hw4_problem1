# Use the cancer dataset to build an SVM classifier to classify the type of cancer 
# (Malignant vs. benign). Plot your classification accuracy, precision, and recall. 
# Explore different kernel tricks to capture non-linearities within your data. 
# Plot the results and compare the accuracies for different kernels. 
# Compare your results against the logistic regression that you have done in homework 3.
# Make sure to explain and elaborate your results.
